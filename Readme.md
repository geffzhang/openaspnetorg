OpenASPNET.ORG
----------------------

**Welcome to the OpenASPNET.ORG project.**

This project is source code for a discussion website, which is used to demonstrate how asp.net core can be used to make a user generated web application. The online instance of this project is hosted at [openaspnet.org](http://openaspnet.org) which is exactly a real community for discussing asp.net core technical topics.

This project is a web application based on the [ASP.NET Core RC2](https://github.com/aspnet/Home/tree/v1.0.0-rc1-update1) open source and cross platform framework. This project will run on [.net core](https://dotnet.github.io/) runtime, but unit testing will still rely on full CLR frameworks(.NET Frmework on Windows and Mono on other systems).

### Using the source

First, clone this repository and compile it to get everything ready:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/jijiechen/openaspnetorg.git
cd openaspnetorg
```

You can work on the source with any text editor or IDE.

To restore packages and compile:

``` 
./build build-all
```

To execute tests:

``` 
./build test
```

### Installation

You need the asp.net core basic environment to run this application. It's pretty simple to run locally when following these steps:

``` 
git clone https://github.com/jijiechen/openaspnetorg.git
cd openaspnetorg
./build build-all
cd src/Discussion.Web
dotnet run
```

By default, the application will use in-memory storage, which will be cleared on process exiting. 

Besides, you can also package artifacts and publish this project to a server. &nbsp;

``` 
./build publish
```

By executing this command, you can get output generated for deploying. Go to `src/Discussion.Web/bin/output` and push contents to your server.
